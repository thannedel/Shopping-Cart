# Shopping-Cart
Based on a real time coding challenge.

# The Task
Create a shopping cart in CodeSandBox. 

The functionality I was asked to implement:
- Display Products
- Create Shopping Cart
- Add/Remove Products
- Change the In Stock property accordingly
- Calculate total amount of money in the cart

I used the fake store API for this simulation.
I extended it by adding pagination and made use of Local Storage, so the cart is not getting empty after page refreshing.
I also created a simple express server to paginate the API.

# Technologies
- React
- Typescript
- Node.js
- Express

### Install server dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Install client dependencies

```bash
cd client
npm install
```

### Run both Express & React from root

```bash
npm run dev
```
